/* The page template. Used when an individual Page is queried. */

/* What Pages Are:
    - Pages are for content that is less time-dependent than Posts.
    - Pages can be organized into pages and subpages.
    - Pages can use different Page Templates which can include Template Files, Template Tags and other PHP code.
    - Pages may have a more complex array of readily available display adjustments when using sophisticated Themes
      with extensive customization.
    - In essence, Pages are for non-blog content. It is possible to remove all or most Posts from a WordPress
      installation, and thus to create a standard non-blog website.
